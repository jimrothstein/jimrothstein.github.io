I seem to forget exact punctuation in R and need a few tries to get it right.
**TryCatch** is one example!

The trick is use formatting so things wrong will stick out.   Rahul !so 12193779 has
excellent example:  Note the use of curly braces {} as well as parenthesis ()

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| collapse: true
#| warning: false

log_calculator <- function(x){
    tryCatch(
        expr = {
            message(log(x))
            message("Successfully executed the log(x) call.")
        },
        error = function(e){
            message('Caught an error!')
            print(e)
        },
        warning = function(w){
            message('Caught an warning!')
            print(w)
        },
        finally = {
            message('All done, quitting.')
        }
    )    
}

log_calculator(10)
log_calculator("10")



```
